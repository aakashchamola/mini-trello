## 4. Real-time System Design

### 4.1 WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events Decision
**Chosen: WebSocket (Socket.IO)**

**Rationale:**
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Required for collaborative features
- **Low Latency**: Critical for real-time drag-and-drop feedback
- **Event-based Architecture**: Perfect for discrete actions (card moves, comments)
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Socket.IO handles connectivity issues gracefully
- **Room Management**: Built-in support for board-specific event channels

### 4.2 Real-time Event Architecture
```
Client Action → API Endpoint → Database Update → Socket Event → All Board Members
```

#### Event Categories
1. **Board Events**: Creation, updates, member changes
2. **List Events**: Creation, updates, reordering, deletion
3. **Card Events**: Creation, updates, movements, deletion
4. **Comment Events**: Creation, updates, deletion
5. **Presence Events**: User join/leave, cursor position, typing indicators

### 4.3 Room-based Event Distribution
```
Board Room: "board-{boardId}"
├── User 1 (Socket Connection)
├── User 2 (Socket Connection)
└── User N (Socket Connection)
```

## 5. Data Flow Architecture

### 5.1 Frontend State Management
- **Server State**: React Query for caching, synchronization, and optimistic updates
- **UI State**: React Context for modals, filters, and temporary state
- **Authentication State**: Persistent context with localStorage integration
- **Real-time State**: Socket event listeners with state updates

### 5.2 Backend Data Flow
```
HTTP Request → Route → Middleware → Controller → Service → Model → Database
                ↓
Socket Event ← BoardEvents ← RealTimeMiddleware ←─────────┘
```

## 6. Deployment Architecture

```

### 6.2 Production Deployment (Recommended)
```
